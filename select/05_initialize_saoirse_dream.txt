(It's a smash hit!)

I've been waiting for the end since like who knows when?
Who knows when?
If I make it to an end, will I love me then?
Love me then?
What thanks I get for being very best?
I'm not the set, I'm the equation
The space I left that I can fit me in
Let's play forget

Counter-clockwise
I've left just at the right time
Thirteen months living just above the baseline
I can't die, blood let from the same knife
Reset twice, no fight, I initialize

So you figured out you're a shooting star
Burning out fast on impact
I could leave without whatever us you are
(I've been waiting for the end since, like, who knows when)
I'm not the part of me that's part of me forever
I can't excise a history to make a point
I'll be around for you to talk it out whenever
(If ever, or never again)

Counter-clockwise
I've left just at the right time
Thirteen months living just above the baseline
I can't die, blood let from the same knife
Reset twice, no fight, I initialize
